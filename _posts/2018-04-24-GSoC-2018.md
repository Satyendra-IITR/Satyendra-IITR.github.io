                                 Woooah 

Magical it was to see my name being in few of those selected for Google Summer of Code program 2018. Finally I made through it. _Yey!!_

This summer I will therefore be working with my organization [Lablua](http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/) and my mentors [Etiene Dalcol](http://etiene.net/main/
about) and [Edward Thomson](http://www.edwardthomson.com/) on writing lua bindings for the libgit2 library in the project **[luagit2](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5790785593671680)** .

[Lablua](http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/) is a research laboratory at PUC-Rio, affiliated with its Computer Science Department. It is dedicated to research 
about programming languages, with emphasis on research involving the Lua language.

**[Libgit2](https://libgit2.github.com/)**

libgit2 is a portable, pure C implementation of the Git core methods provided as a re-entrant linkable library with a solid API, allowing you to write 
native speed custom Git applications in any language which supports C bindings.

In my project I will make library lua compatible and ready to be easily used by lua users. I will be using [luaC-API](https://www.lua.org/pil/24.html) for 
the purpose and will write tests using [Lunit](https://luarocks.org/modules/luarocks/lunit).

The code is available at https://github.com/SatyendraBanjare/luagit2 and documentation will be made available at  http://luagit2.readthedocs.io/ as I write 
bindings. I will write blog post on my work progress in comming days.
