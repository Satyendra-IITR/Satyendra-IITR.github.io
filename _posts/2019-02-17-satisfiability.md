SAT or Satisfiability type problem is the problem of determining if there exists a solution to a boolean formula. It checks if a combination of true/False values exist that evaluated the given boolean expression to true.

The representation of a boolean formula is expressed in Conjuctive Normal Form.

The problem's complexity can be broadly classifed as Unrestricted and restricted or SAT-3. The key difference being that the element may be present any number of time in a conjuctive clause in Unrestricted form and exactly once in a restricted form.

### Significance

It was the first problem that was proved to be **NP-complete**. Till date there exists no known algorithm that solves every given SAT problem in a polynominal problem.

The wide areas of SAT solving are artificial intelligence, circuit design and Automatic theorem proving.

Recently [Urmila Mahadev](https://simons.berkeley.edu/people/urmila-mahadev) theoretically formalized the long standing question of Quantum computation, How to know whether anything Quantum has happened ?. In her method she has reduced the complex problem to SAT-3 instance problems.
