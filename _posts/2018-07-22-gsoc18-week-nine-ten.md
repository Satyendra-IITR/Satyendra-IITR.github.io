These last two weeks I have completed writing lua bindings to most of the modules, all main modules are 
complete as in both their lua bindings and tests. The complete list of 
functions that I have worked upon all this summer is available here at : 
[docs-link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UxPh6gXlJzzQ1XyftjqV7B3cpYoQV-mAvp9nZFj_Etw/edit?usp=sharing). _(this 
might change over the next two weeks, more additions for sure )_ :smiley: :smiley:

The Tests for most of modules has also been completed . The code is currently being reviewed by my 
mentors.

I am very happy with the work I have done so far now :blush: . I am now working on writing examples and 
documentation and explainatory comments as part of the last task for the GSoC 2018.
