**L**inear **T**emporal **L**ogic is a logic system that defines the behaviour of `Stream of States` using conditional statements that are represented as a mathematical reduction formulae. The future states can be encoded using present states, combining logic operators and rules of existence.

These rules are **N**ext, **G**lobally, **F**uture (Eventually), **R**elease , **U**ntil, **W**eakUntil , **M** (Strong Release).

The basic semantics , semantics and basic properties are discussed on [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic). 

In this post I will try to explore coq formalization of the same. 

I created a very basic version of LTL implementation in coq. The more advanced formalization I found are
-	https://github.com/foreverbell/verified/tree/master/ltl
-	https://github.com/coq-contribs/ltl

I highly advice going through them. They will surely give every reader a new inspiration to think about this topic. Finally the superset of LTL called as ** CTL ** has also been formalized and can be accessed here : https://github.com/coq-contribs/ctltctl .
