    I am Satyendra Kumar Banjare 3rd year Electrical Engineering undergraduate student at IIT Roorkee. My current interests are web and software development and security analysis.

    I wrote my first Hello World program in my first semester and since then I am a self taught developer exploring the field. My hobby is learning about different programming languages. I love reading about compilers, concurrency and type theory.
