Here are some of my experiences and findings on the topics 
[Functional-Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming),	
[type-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory),
[proof-assistants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant) and related fields.

* I have been reading about Type theory, logic systems and Proof Assistants these days and thus compiled a short eport on the same. It is avilable here [Type Theory notes](https://github.com/SatyendraBanjare/Type-Theory-notes).
